ERC20 Staking Contract README
Overview
This Solidity contract implements an ERC20 token staking mechanism. Users can stake their ERC20 tokens to earn rewards based on the staking duration and a predefined reward rate.

Features
Staking: Users can stake their ERC20 tokens by transferring them to the contract.
Rewards: Stakers earn rewards based on the amount staked and the duration of the stake.
Withdrawal: Stakers can withdraw their staked tokens and earned rewards after the staking period ends.
Customizable: The contract allows the owner to update the reward rate and staking duration.
Usage
Deploy the contract:

Create a new Solidity file for your deployment script (e.g., deploy.js).
Import the necessary libraries and contract.
Configure the deployment parameters (e.g., network, initial reward rate, staking duration).
Deploy the contract using a suitable deployment tool (e.g., Truffle, Hardhat).
Stake tokens:

Call the stake function from your frontend or other application, passing the desired amount of tokens.
Withdraw tokens and rewards:

Call the withdraw function after the staking period has ended.
Configuration
The contract has the following configurable parameters:

rewardRate: The reward rate per unit of time (e.g., tokens per second).
stakingDuration: The minimum staking duration in seconds.
These parameters can be updated by the contract owner using the updateRewardRate and updateStakingDuration functions.

Security Considerations
Reentrancy attacks: Ensure that the contract is protected against reentrancy attacks by using appropriate patterns or libraries.
Integer overflows: Be cautious of integer overflows and underflows in calculations.
Token transfer safety: Use the safeTransferFrom function provided by the ERC20 token standard for safe token transfers.
Access control: Implement proper access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized modifications.
